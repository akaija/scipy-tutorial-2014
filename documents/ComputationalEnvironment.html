    <h1 id="computational-environment">Computational Environment</h1>
<p>Even though computers are often considered deterministic, computational
software is a rapidly evolving and changing landscape. Libraries are constantly
adding new features and fixing issues. Even libraries with the strictest
backwards-compatibility policies can change in significant ways. As computer
hardware evolves, software is forced to adapt accordingly.</p>
<p>A reproducible computational environment is sufficiently consistent for the
computational task at hand. For example, this can consist of a similar CPU
instruction set, libraries and executables available with a specific version
and configuration options, a specific operating system version, etc.</p>
<h2 id="docker">Docker</h2>
<p><img alt="Docker stack" src="http://tiewei.github.io/images/docker-filesystems-multilayer.png" width="350"></p>
<p>Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any
application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that will run
virtually anywhere.</p>
<p><img alt="Container vs VMs" src="http://tiewei.github.io/images/docker_vm.jpg" width="350"></p>
<p>Docker works with images that consume minimal disk space, versioned, archiveable, and shareable.
Executing applications in these images does not require dedicated resources and is high performance.

<h2 id="virtual-machines">Virtual Machines</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, a Virtual Machine (VM) emulates a physical computer. In
the last few years, VM's have become very popular because of their scalability,
ease of maintenance, and reproducibility. </p>
<p>Vagrant is a software that defines and controls the virtual machine
environment. These machines are generally able to work together and can be
associated with each other. Some use-cases people are using multi-machine
environments for today:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Accurately modeling a multi-server production topology, such as separating a web and database server.  </li>
<li>Modeling a distributed system and how they interact with each other.  </li>
<li>Testing an interface, such as an API to a service component.  </li>
<li>Disaster-case testing: machines dying, network partitions, slow networks, inconsistent world views, etc.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Many software packages provide virtualization on modern computer architectures
such as VMWare, Virtual Box, Parallels etc.</p>
<h2 id="package-managers-and-distributions">Package managers and distributions</h2>
<p>Part of the problem in creating a computational environment is the procurement of
necessary libraries and other dependencies. Linux distributions have long been a source of
extensive scientific development resources. Package managers like <a href="http://brew.sh/">HomeBrew</a>
and <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> are also available for OSX and Windows. On Linux, yum
(http://yum.baseurl.org) is the command line package management for rpm systems, and 
dpkg (https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg) is the  software for Debian package management system. Scientific
Python distributions are also available like <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda</a>,
<a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/">Canopy</a> or <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/">PythonX,Y</a>.</p>
