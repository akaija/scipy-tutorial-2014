<p>TODO: Why reproducible computational enviroment is important.  What the
characteristics of a reproducible computational environment are.</p>
<h2 id="docker">Docker</h2>
<p>Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any
application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that will
run virtually anywhere.</p>

<h2 id="vms">VM's</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, the VM (Virtual Machine) emulates a physical machine as such computers. In the last few years, VM has become very popular because of their scalability, ease of maintenance, and reproducibility. </p>
<p>Vagrant is a software to define and control virtual machine environemnt. These machines are generally able to work   together or are somehow associated with each other. Here are some use-cases people are using multi-machine environments for today:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Accurately modeling a multi-server production topology, such as separating a web and database server.  </li>
<li>Modeling a distributed system and how they interact with each other.  </li>
<li>Testing an interface, such as an API to a service component.<br />
Disaster-case testing: machines dying, network partitions, slow networks, inconsistent world views, etc.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Many software packages provides virtualization on modern computer architecture such as VMWare, Virtual Box, Parallels etc. You will find many online blogs on comparison betweek Docker and VM (For eg. http://www.pcworld.com/article/2095460/docker-challenges-virtualization-market-with-containers.html)   . </p>
