<h2 id="create-a-project">Create a project</h2>
<p>Sign up for a free OpenScienceFramework account at [https://osf.io/login/]
Create a project on the Open Science Framework (http://osf.io). Click on the contributors link, and add a contributor. Edit the project's wiki to reflect the goals of the study.</p>
<h3 id="registration">Registration</h3>
<p>Take a snapshop of the project now before we begin data collection by going to the registrations tab and clicking register project. Use the pre-data collection registration template. This has created a frozen version of the project that can be uniquely cited; it always contains a link back to the original project.</p>
<h3 id="components">Components</h3>
<p>Go back to the original project.</p>
<p>Components are organizational units. If there is a part of the project that someone may be interested in individually (to use or cite), authorship is different for a given aspect of the project (e.g., analysis vs data collection), or there are different authorization settings (e.g., users have different privelages or certain aspects of the data are public while others are not (e.g., data can't be made available publically but analytic files can), then that suggests a component should be used.</p>
<p>Add a data component, Data. Inside that component, inherit the project's contributor by importing the parent's contributors. Change the order of the authors in the contributors tab. In the component settings, add a figshare add-on. Use your figshare credentials and connect the images you added during data collection.</p>
<p>Add an analysis component, Analysis. Add a fewInside that component, connect your Github repository. Click on files. Add a new file by dragging and dropping into the Github folder. Your contributors do not need to know how to use git to work with the repository. Make this component public. Step back into the main project and make the project public.</p>
